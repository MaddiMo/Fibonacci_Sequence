# Fibonacci Sequence in PYTHON 

I have created 2 different ways to create the sequence using a normal WHILE loop and RECURSION.

## What is Fibonacci series: 

A series of numbers in which each number (Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding numbers is called as the Fibonacci Series.

It can be a sequence that goes to infinity:

    1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ....

**A bit of history**

was first discussed in Europe by Leonardo of Pisa (whose nickname was Fibonacci) in the early 13th century, although the sequence can be traced back to about 200 BCE in Indian literature. This sequence has produced a large amount of literature and has connections to many branches of mathematics.
